# fm_test_assert_no_errexit_leak <label>: refuse to continue when errexit is on.
#
# Every suite that sources this library runs its tests with errexit OFF, so each
# test can tolerate a nonzero exit and report it through fail(). A test that
# turns errexit on - typically by "restoring" it with `set -e` after a `set +e`
# borrowed from an errexit suite - silently changes every LATER test in the
# file: from that point the first deliberately tolerated nonzero command aborts
# the run before it can reach fail(), so the suite prints no `not ok` line and
# zero bytes of stderr, which exit code alone cannot tell apart from a flake.
#
# Call this where a test ends, so the diagnostic names the test that leaked
# instead of leaving the next one to die without one. It reads live shell state
# rather than source bytes, so it cannot pass vacuously.
# Suites that still leak errexit, measured by running every suite with this
# check in report mode rather than by matching source patterns. The number on
# each entry is how many of that suite's tests currently run with errexit left
# on, so the list carries its own progress and nobody has to re-measure to see
# where the work stands. `unmeasured` means the suite stops early or is gated
# off on the platform the count was taken on, so its leak is proven but its
# extent is not; it still fires this check wherever the suite runs to completion.
#
# THIS LIST IS CLOSED TO ADDITIONS. It exists only so this check could land at
# all while the suites that predate it are worked off one at a time. A suite
# that is not named here - a new one, or a copy of one that is - must fail the
# check. That is the entire point of the check, and it is the one property this
# list must never be widened to soften.
#
# An entry is removed by FIXING the suite, never by silencing it: delete its
# `set +e` / `set -e` pairs, because capturing `rc=$?` after a bare command
# works identically without them, and then give every setup step the leaked
# errexit had been silently enforcing an explicit `|| fail`, so a broken fixture
# names the step that broke instead of surfacing as a confusing assertion
# further down. Dropping the pairs without that second half trades a silent
# abort for a silent skip. tests/fm-remote-job.test.sh is the worked example.
#
# A setup step that is a function called inside a command substitution
# (`x=$(helper)`) needs its own internal `|| fail` first: `fail`'s `exit` only
# ends that subshell, so the function's exit status is whatever its last
# command left, and a caller's `|| fail` on the assignment cannot fire unless
# the function's own last command reflects the failure. Add the check inside
# the function, then keep the caller's check so a signalled failure actually
# stops the test instead of continuing against a fixture that was never built.
# `fm_fakebin` and tests/wake-helpers.sh's `make_case`/`make_fake_crew_state`
# are the worked examples for that shape.

# --- self-cleaning temp root ------------------------------------------------
#
# fm_test_tmproot <prefix> echoes a fresh temp dir and registers it for removal
# on EXIT/INT/TERM. A test file that needs extra teardown (e.g. killing a
# daemon) should define its own EXIT trap and call fm_test_cleanup from inside
# it so registered dirs are still removed.
#
# The call site is almost always `TMP_ROOT=$(fm_test_tmproot prefix)`, which
# forks a subshell to capture stdout. Anything that function does to the
# current shell's state - an array append, a trap - dies with that subshell
# and never reaches the real caller, so registration cannot go through
# in-process state. `$$` is the one thing bash keeps stable across that
# boundary (it always resolves to the invoking shell's PID, not the
# subshell's - see `man bash` on `$$`), so fm_test_tmproot records the
# directory in a `$$`-keyed registry file instead, and the trap that reaps
# that file is armed once, here, at source time - which always runs in the
# real caller, never a subshell.
